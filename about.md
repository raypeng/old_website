# About Me

Hey guys! Greetings from Rui Peng or Ray (how my first name pronounces)!

I am currently a final year student major in Computer Science in HKUST. My interests lie primarily in Software Development and Computer Vision. I am doing a final year thesis on [Video Object Detection](http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2015/#vid), which is an exciting topic not yet solved well by state-of-the-art.

My favorite programming languages are C++ (for its efficiency), Python (for its wide range of support in research) and above all Ruby (for its pure elegance in OOP). I like reading books and articles about new technologies and I listen to a range of podcasts.

And if you insist, a copy of my CV [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/CV-PENGRUI.pdf). :)

# A few stuff I really like to share with you:

[Software Engineering Radio](http://www.se-radio.net/)

* explores cutting edge software technologies (agile, cloud, compilers, you name it)
* has been there for more than 10 years

[Teahour](http://teahour.fm/)

* a Chinese podcast on software development and product development
* run by a bunch of rubyists

[Ruby China](https://ruby-china.org/)

* the best software developer community in China

By the way, some notes I have taken while I listened to those podcasts [here](https://github.com/raypeng/podcast-notes).
