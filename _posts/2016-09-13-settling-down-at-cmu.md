It's been two weeks since school started. Carnegie Mellon has been awesome -- you always have tons of work to do lol. Now that course registration has been settled after much trial-and-error, I am currently taking Machine Learning, Machine Learning with Large Datasets, Intermediate Statistics, Distributed Systems. Due to workload restrictions, I have to drop Deep Learning taught by Ruslan -- he is such a great lecturer I have to say, you know, always smiling. I designed my courses as such mainly to spread my exposure to many aspects -- they span core stat, core ML algorithms, special ML scale up techniques, and system-y must-know distributed thinking. Let me just hope four courses (probably gonna take me 70 hrs/week) are not going to kill me and affect my internship search.

Let's aim high and go big!
