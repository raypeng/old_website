Martin Fowler's blog: [martinfowler.com](http://www.martinfowler.com/)

---

There are many many blogs there on that website. What's interesting at this moment to me, is that this guy never hides his love for his company he has worked for 14 years now.

By reading the blogs below, I have grown to be more convinced of the values of the company, especially the three pillars.

[Three Pillars](http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/ThreePillars.html): introduces the core values of the company and how these affect its business and impact.

[Roy's Social Experiment](http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/RoysSocialExperiment.html): tells us why TW existed at all - it was created to challenge the world on some "common sense".

[People Matter Most](http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/PeopleMatterMost.html): explains the mutual attraction between talents and TW.

[ThoughtWorks China](http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/ThoughtWorksChina.html): says why TW has to open an office in China.
