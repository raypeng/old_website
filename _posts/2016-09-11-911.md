Today marks the fifteenth year after 9/11 incident. I wasn't having very strong feelings about this piece of history until I saw [this video](http://goo.gl/wSO6x1) today. It's a simple documentary that tries to be objective, putting all the hypothesis and conspiracy away. I was nothing but shocked after I saw this, especially after my short trips to NYC in the past month. Nobody can imagine the pain people in NYC and all across US have gone through. I hate terrorism to the bottom since what needs to be held paramount to anything else is humanity and human lives...

It's good to see US and NYC getting out of the shadow of this horrible past. People start to get back to the original lives and the economy has recovered as well. I sincerely wish there will be no more terrorism in the world and people all get to live the best of their lives!

Live long and prosper!

Here is a photo I took looking at lower Manhattan from Brooklyn bridge!
