Talk here: [DL School Day 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyovmAtoUx0&feature=youtu.be&t=3h48m50s)

His tips are really realistic and motivational:

* take ML courses
* watch DL school talks
* PhD student process 1: read many many papers (you will have original ide
a after 20-50 papers)
* PhD student process 2: replicate results
* treasure dirty works (clean data, tune params, hack GPU, etc)

Saturday Story:

There are no short term rewards in doing all these... After a weekend, you are barely better at your job. But the secret to advance your career is weekend after weekend after a year, you will become really good at this. Everyone at Stanford got better this way.
