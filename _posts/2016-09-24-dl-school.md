Talk here: [DL School Day 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyovmAtoUx0&feature=youtu.be&t=3h48m50s)

His tips are really realistic and motivational:
1.   take ML courses
2.   watch DL school talks
3.1  PhD student process 1: read many many papers (you will have original idea after 20-50 papers)
3.2  PhD student process 2: replicate results
4.   treasure dirty works (clean data, tune params, hack GPU, etc)

Saturday Story:
There are no short term rewards in doing all these... After a weekend, you are barely better at your job. But the secret to advance your career is weekend after weekend after a year, you will become really good at this. Everyone at Stanford got better this way.
