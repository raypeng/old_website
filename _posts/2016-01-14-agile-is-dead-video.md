A simple summary:

"Agile is Dead" meaning the implementation is wrong -- people following "the way" for software development without much thinking! However, there are still values in "Agility" (not "Agile", cuz you can't simply have an adjective).

---

What we learn from Agility:

<pre>
what to do:
- find out where you are
- take a small step towards your goal
- adjust your understanding based on what you learned
- repeat

how to do it:
- when faced with two or more alternatives that deliver roughly the same value,
take the path that makes future change easier.
</pre>

And there is a [blog](http://pragdave.me/blog/2014/03/04/time-to-kill-agile/) written by Dave Thomas on this topic in very good detail.
